tesseract can't recognize tables
i want to solve this problem.
* idea is to detect all cells and recognize text inside and put in one row
* idea to detect column-based text and recognize as a columns
* idea to detect table and export it to dataframe (Maybe the hardest to impelement)

* sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
